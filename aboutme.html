    <h1>About Danny</h1>
    <p>Welcome everyone, I'm a third year at URI, pursuing a Psychology B.S. I'm trying out coding/programming and testing out if I could make this a minor and a potential career option. I know this career field is always giving out well paying jobs so might as well give it a shot. More about me, I'm currently into weight lifting, I was more of a sports person back in highschool, I played some basketball and volleyball but not enough to pursue in college. Thank you for checking out my first website.</p>
